#Description
As of right now, 14% of the U.S. are unable to read. To give you a better idea, that is 32 million people. To further the gravity of this issue, this statistic hasnâ€™t changed in 10 years. 

This is where Unravel comes in. We believe that by using emerging touchscreen and interactive technology, we will be able to motivate and inspire people of all ages to learn to read in a tactile, more immediate way. Our main goal is to introduce reading to our users with a sense of inherent playfulness and hands-on activity. 

While this is just our first version of this application, we plan on scaling it up in ways that allow users to build upon their vocabularies and their understanding of language that encourages them to explore literacy beyond the bounds of rote memorization. 
Experimentation has been fundamental to this project, because language is meant to be traversed rather than acquired. 

Ultimately, Unravel aims to move the concept of literacy into an entirely new approach to reading, and we hope to be a small part of changing the landscape of language in a way that is inclusive, fun and exciting.
